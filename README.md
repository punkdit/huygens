huygens
=======

This is a python package for drawing diagrams.
Intended to have multiple backends, currently the only
backend implemented uses [cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/).

It can also include text from TeX via pdftex, pdflatex, xetex or xelatex.

Diagrams are able to be composed in various ways, based 
on a linear constraint solver. Therefore, this system becomes
a declarative graphics layout package.
